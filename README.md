## 📊 Output

Results are written to an Apify Dataset and can be exported as:

- JSON
- CSV
- Excel
- XML

The Dataset can then be used in:

- CRM enrichment
- Spreadsheets
- Lead research workflows
- Market analysis
- Ecommerce research
- Automation pipelines

---

## 🧪 Deployment & Testing

The Actor is deployed publicly on Apify and has been tested through successful Actor runs.

Actual runtime and result count depend on:

- Input size
- Website response times
- Publicly available content
- Anti-bot protections
- Catalog endpoint availability
- External website behavior

No fixed accuracy percentage or runtime is guaranteed.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

Some Shopify stores may:

- Hide email addresses
- Load content dynamically
- Restrict automated access
- Block product endpoints
- Hide social links
- Expose limited app fingerprints

Because of this, some fields may be empty.

### Email Data

The Actor extracts publicly available email addresses.

It does not guarantee that an email address is:

- Active
- Monitored
- Owned by a founder or decision-maker
- Suitable for outreach

Users should independently validate contact information before using it.

### App Detection

Detected apps indicate recognizable frontend signals only.

A store may use an application without exposing a detectable frontend identifier.

---

## 🔐 Responsible Use

Use this Actor only for lawful purposes and in accordance with:

- Applicable privacy laws
- Website terms
- Marketing regulations
- Apify platform policies

The Actor is intended for research and extraction of publicly accessible business information.
